## How to get started locally

### Flutter Frontend

#### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed
- Dart installed
- A valid backend API URL (already deployed on GCP)

### Setup

**Step 1:** Navigate to project directory and get dependencies

```bash
cd vazhi
flutter pub get
```

**Step 2:** Create a .env file and add the server url.

The server for the app is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. The Flutter app requires the URL to communicate with the server. So create a .env file in project directory and add the following line:

```bash
GEMINI_URL=https://gemini-api-backend-140623945393.asia-south1.run.app/gemini
```

By default, the app connects to this live backend URL. You can change it if you host your own.

That's it!! Now if you want to configure the server by yourself, the code is in 'python_backend' directory. 

**Remember to create a .env file and add your own API key.** 

Pull requests are welcome! If you‚Äôd like to improve the app or add new features, please fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
